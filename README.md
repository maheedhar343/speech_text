🎉 Excited to share my latest project: Audio to Text Conversion Using Flask! 🚀

This project leverages the power of Python libraries like SpeechRecognition, PyAudio, and Flask (along with Flask-CORS) to create a seamless audio-to-text transcription system. It's designed to efficiently convert spoken words into written text, with a user-friendly interface powered by Flask.

Key Highlights:
🔹 SpeechRecognition: Accurately processes audio input to generate text.
🔹 PyAudio: Captures high-quality audio for processing.
🔹 Flask: Powers the web framework for hosting the application.
🔹 Flask-CORS: Ensures smooth integration across different platforms.

Feel free to explore, fork, and share your feedback. A special thanks to the amazing developer community for the resources and guidance!
